# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The Purpose of the analysis was to determine if paid reviews had bias.  This was a review of reviews for home improvement products on Amazon that could be seperated by whether it was a paid or unpaid review.

## Results: 
- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 255 paid reviews and 36400 unpaid reviews.

- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 120 paid reviews that were 5 stars.  There were 17167 unpaid 5 star reviews.

- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
47% of paid reviews were rated as 5.  47% of unpaid reviews were also rated as 5.

- Summary: 
Based on the percentage of 5 scores for reviews both being 47% for paid and upaid reviews, the data doesn't suggest there is bias in paid reviews.

One additional analysis to support the statement would be to compare the same results without filtering by reviews noted as being helpful.  I would expect for the similar trends to be seen.
